## User input

<a href="./week04-index.html" class="btn btn-default">Week 4 Topics</a> 

---

# Prerequisites:

* Plan your solution, write out the flow diagram before you code the solution.
* Use a nice user interface, you can create a title and use `********` to create line breaks.
* End each application with a `Console.ReadKey();` so that the application ends gracefully
* Use the code snippet to create a clean running application

---

# 1: Get a value from a userinput

* Create an application that asks for the user's first name and print it to the screen.
* Add a second question to the program asking them for their last name, which is then printed to the screen.

---

# 2: Ask the user for a number input

* Create an application that requires the user to type in a number, the app cannot crash if the input is not a number.
* Create a forloop that uses that number and prints the times tables up to the number 12 on the screen
* Alter the content of the forloop to show the whole calculation

---

# 3: Use a forloop to ask for multiple things

* Create an application that asks the user for their 5 favourite fruits.
* The question may only be coded once, but needs to be asked 5 times. Each time the new answer needs to be added to a single variable.

* Display the fruits in ascending order
* Display the fruits in a reverse order

---

# 4: Use a forloop to ask for a set of numbers

* Create an application that asks the user for 5 numbers
* Check that these values are numbers
* Display the sum of all of these numbers (Add them all together)
* Display the average value of the numbers. (Add them all together and then divide them by the amount of numbers)

---

# 5: Convert KM to Miles

* Create an application that converts KM to Miles (Show 2 decimal places)
* Create an application that converts Miles to KM (Show 2 decimal places)

To convert KM to Miles use this formula: `KM * 0.62137119`
To convert Miles to KM use this formula: `MILE * 1.609344`
