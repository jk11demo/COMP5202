# What is psuedocode

Pseudo code is a simple, plain language type of programming - not coding.  
It is a description language that allows us to communicate our ideas.  
Pseudo code can look like code, but it can also be written in a plain language. There is really no right or wrong way about it as long as it works for you and your team.  
Again pseudo code can be written and is often initially written outside of a code editor.

# How to use psuedocode

* Use comments in your code to transfer the psuedocode

In both C# and JavaScript you can use comments:

```charp
// to set comments for a single line
```

```js
/* 
    to set comments 
    for a single line 
*/
```

* Write your psuedocode outside of your code editor so you can make sure your program works properly before you code it.

* Write your pseudocode using flow diagrams

* Map psuedo code to UML Diagrams (later in the course)

* Remember that planning is at least 80% of the process
