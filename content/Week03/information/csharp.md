# Recap on Variables

So variables are important, naming is just as important.

Let's have a look how we can use them in a picture.

# Some C# specific things

`var` => Variables are inferred, can be used from the block they are declared and deeper.(Variable Scope)

`const <type>` => When declaring a constant, you need to define the type.

`<type>` => If you define a variable using a type, then you do not need to initialise it with a value, although there is not a really good reason for this.
